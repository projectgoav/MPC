  <h1>The Future of Mossneuk</h1>
  <br>
  <p>At Mossneuk we're hoping to give our building a face lift and turn it into something not just for the church family but the wider community! This involves adding on an extension featuring a brand-new Cafe &amp; kitchen area at the front of the church. Changes will be made inside the church as well with an increased foyer size to reduce bottlenecks at busy times and an updated sanctuary. Below are some plans and renders of what the church might look like after its face lift.
