  <h1>Worship <small> Every Sunday at 10am </small></h1>
  <p>Mossneuk meets every Sunday at 10am. There is a <a href="groups.html">Sunday Club</a> available for children. Tea &amp; Coffee is provided after the service.</p>
  <p>We trust that you will feel very much at home with us and I know that you will receive a great welcome from our people. For the past twenty-five years Mossneuk Parish Church has existed to share the good news of Jesus Christ with the local community. If there is anything we can do to make your visit special please do not hesitate to ask. </p>
  <p>Our contemporary worship is led by <a href="people.html">our ministers</a> and our singing is led by our <a href="groups.html">Praise Band</a>.</p>
